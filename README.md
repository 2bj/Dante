#Dante Editor

just another Medium Editor

##Motivation:

I´ve tried all the medium clones out there, they are really great and all have it´s pros & cons, but none of them have all the features that medium wysywig have, so I wonder, how difficult could be build my own Medium clone?, Well , I'm not a js gurú, so I´ve use some dependences to ease this task - jQuery, Backbone/Underscore & Sanitize - perhaps in the future I could get rid of those , but for the moment this dependencies let me write less LOC and makes the base code in order.


## Features:

+ Cleaning Html when pasted and loaded
+ Upload of Images and caption option
